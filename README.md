# Intelligent Snake Game

## Overview
This project involves the development of an intelligent agent for the classic Snake game. The agent intelligently navigates a game board, avoiding obstacles and efficiently collecting food items. The project explores both a table-driven approach and a machine learning-based approach using reinforcement learning for controlling the snake's movements.

### Features
- **Two Control Approaches**: Table-driven and machine learning-based control for the snake.
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: The agent uses perceptions to make informed decisions and navigate the game board.
- **Efficient Food Collection**: Strategies for efficient food collection and obstacle avoidance.
